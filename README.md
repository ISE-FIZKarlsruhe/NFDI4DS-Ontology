# NFDI4DS-Ontology

This is version v1.0.0 of the nfdi4dso ontology.
The vision of [NFDI4DataScience (NFDI4DS)](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) is to support all steps of the complex and interdisciplinary research data lifecycle in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Towards this goal, the NFDI$DS Ontology (nfdi4dso) is created. nfdi4dso is a module that builds upon the NFDIcore Ontology (https://ise-fizkarlsruhe.github.io/nfdicore/2.0.0/) and maintains alignment with the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/), [schema.org](https://schema.org/), the [FaBiO ontology](http://purl.org/spar/fabio), and the [Conference Ontology](https://w3id.org/scholarlydata/ontology/conference-ontology.owl).
